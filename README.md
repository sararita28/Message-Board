# Message-Board
Forum/Mini Message Board
This web platform is a simple message board where people can write messages and read other people's messages. You can give your post a title, you can leave your name 
and a date will automatically be appended to your post upon submitting it. The code stack used is React NodeJS, Express, Pug.. An improvement would be to connect the app
to a database such as MongoDB
